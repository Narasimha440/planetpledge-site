            <p class="mb-4">
                Climate change is driven by various factors, including greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and industrial pollution. These changes lead to severe weather patterns, rising sea levels, and biodiversity loss. For instance, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing global temperatures to rise.
            </p>
            <img src="img/climate-change.jpg" alt="Climate Change Effects" class="w-full rounded-lg mb-4">
            <p>
                The consequences of climate change affect us all, from increased frequency of natural disasters to the displacement of communities. By taking action now, we can mitigate these effects and work towards a sustainable future for generations to come.

            <p>
                The AQI is a measure of air quality that informs the public about how polluted the air is and how it affects health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the AQI is crucial for protecting public health, especially for sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions. By staying informed about air quality, we can take appropriate actions to safeguard our health and the environment.
